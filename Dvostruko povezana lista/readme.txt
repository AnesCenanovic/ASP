This C++ code defines a generic `Lista` class and a concrete implementation `DvostrukaLista` (doubly linked list). 

**Key Features:**

* **Generic Programming:** The `Lista` class is a template, allowing it to work with different data types.
* **Doubly Linked List:** `DvostrukaLista` implements a doubly linked list data structure, providing efficient insertion and deletion at any position.
* **Iterator:** An `Iterator` class is provided for traversing the list.
* **Basic List Operations:** Includes methods for:
    * Adding elements (at the beginning/end)
    * Removing elements
    * Accessing elements by index
    * Getting the current element
    * Moving between elements (next, previous)
    * Finding the beginning and end of the list
    * Calculating list size
* **Testing:** Includes basic test functions to verify the functionality of some methods.
