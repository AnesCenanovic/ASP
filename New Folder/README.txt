This C++ project demonstrates the implementation of two types of associative containers (maps): a binary search tree-based map (BinStabloMapa) and an array-based map (NizMapa). Both classes are templates that support key-value pairs and provide functionality such as adding, deleting, and accessing elements. Additionally, performance testing is done for both implementations to compare execution time.
